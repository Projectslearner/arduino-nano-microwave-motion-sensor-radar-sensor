# Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR module with an Arduino Nano to detect motion. The sensor module emits microwave signals and detects changes in the reflected signal when motion occurs within its detection range. When motion is detected, the sensor outputs a digital signal to the Arduino Nano.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Nano**
- **Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram

#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - **Signal Pin:** Connect to digital pin 2 on Arduino Nano.
   - **VCC:** Connect to 5V on Arduino Nano.
   - **GND:** Connect to GND on Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the Microwave Motion Sensor RADAR module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the serial monitor output. When motion is detected (sensor value == HIGH), it should print "Motion Detected!".

#### Applications

- **Motion Detection:** Use for applications where detecting motion is necessary, such as security systems, automation, or interactive installations.
- **Occupancy Sensing:** Implement in projects requiring occupancy detection for energy-saving applications.
- **Smart Home Integration:** Useful for integrating motion sensing into smart home automation systems.

#### Notes

- Ensure the sensor module is correctly connected to the Arduino Nano and powered.
- Adjust the code logic or sensitivity settings in the sensor module if needed for your specific application.
- Consider adding additional components or features based on your project requirements.
